## Project Description

A small JavaScript project for managing a personal book library. Users can view, add, remove, and toggle the read status of books using a simple interface.

## Features

-   Display a list of books as interactive cards.
-   Add new books via a modal form.
-   Delete books from the library.
-   Toggle the read status of any book.
-   Responsive and styled with CSS Grid.
-   Dynamic rendering using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5** – for semantic structure.
-   **CSS3** – for layout and styling using Grid.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)** – for dynamic behavior and DOM manipulation.
-   **Object Constructor Function** – used to define the `Book` objects.
-   **Prototype Method** – added to `Book.prototype` to toggle read status efficiently and demonstrate object-oriented principles.
-   **crypto.randomUUID()** – to generate unique IDs for each book.
-   **`<dialog>` HTML Element** – for modal functionality.

## Optional Ideas for Future

-   Save books to localStorage for persistence.
-   Add book cover image support.
-   Sort/filter by read status or title.
-   Improve accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).
